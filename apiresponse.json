It\u2019s not a radical idea. Not even a new one. For years, FP&amp;A vendors have been talking about finance that is \u201cstrategic' and planning that\u2019s \u201cconnected.' We\u2019re still waiting.</p><p>In a world where finance is under more pressure than ever to be more strategic and more collaborative \u2014 why isn\u2019t this already a solved problem? For the last four years, our team has been trying to find an answer to that question.</p> <p><strong>This is our answer:</strong></p><p>Saving time is not enough. Controls are not enough. Building just for finance is not enough. Those things are all table stakes. For finance to be strategic, we have to collaborate. And real collaboration requires shared context. But you can share every spreadsheet, and open up every source of data \u2014 all the context in the world doesn\u2019t matter if the people you work with don\u2019t even understand what they\u2019re looking at.</p> <p><strong>Understanding. Deep, intuitive, clear understanding \u2014 throughout the entire business \u2014 that is at the heart of this problem.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s why we built Runway: a finance platform that makes all your work \u2014 from modeling to data wrangling, from forecasting to scenario planning \u2014 finally understandable to you and everyone else in your team. So everyone has the same business context, and can come together to drive the kind of strategic impact you know you can deliver.</p> <p><strong>Ultimately, seeing is believing.</strong></p><p>Through this brief video, through our website, and through stories from teams at AngelList, Superhuman, ConvertKit, and 818 Tequila, we hope to show you a small glimpse of what Runway can do for you. And why we\u2019re here.</p> <p>When you\u2019re ready, come talk to us. We\u2019d love to help.</p>",

        "story": "<p><strong>Finance isn\u2019t just about finance\u2014it\u2019s about everything.</strong></p> <p><strong>Four years ago, we asked ourselves a simple question:</strong></p><p>What if everyone could understand how their business actually works? It\u2019s not a radical idea. Not even a new one. For years, FP&amp;A vendors have been talking about finance that is \u201cstrategic' and planning that\u2019s \u201cconnected.' We\u2019re still waiting.</p><p>In a world where finance is under more pressure than ever to be more strategic and more collaborative \u2014 why isn\u2019t this already a solved problem? For the last four years, our team has been trying to find an answer to that question.</p> <p><strong>This is our answer:</strong></p><p>Saving time is not enough. Controls are not enough. Building just for finance is not enough. Those things are all table stakes. For finance to be strategic, we have to collaborate. And real collaboration requires shared context. But you can share every spreadsheet, and open up every source of data \u2014 all the context in the world doesn\u2019t matter if the people you work with don\u2019t even understand what they\u2019re looking at.</p> <p><strong>Understanding. Deep, intuitive, clear understanding \u2014 throughout the entire business \u2014 that is at the heart of this problem.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s why we built Runway: a finance platform that makes all your work \u2014 from modeling to data wrangling, from forecasting to scenario planning \u2014 finally understandable to you and everyone else in your team. So everyone has the same business context, and can come together to drive the kind of strategic impact you know you can deliver.</p> <p><strong>Ultimately, seeing is believing.</strong></p><p>Through this brief video, through our website, and through stories from teams at AngelList, Superhuman, ConvertKit, and 818 Tequila, we hope to show you a small glimpse of what Runway can do for you. And why we\u2019re here.</p> <p>When you\u2019re ready, come talk to us. We\u2019d love to help.</p>",
